1. when paused - clicking a cue button needs to remove all tracks, un-pause, then start the new one immediately


2. stopping and pausing should set meters to -64db  - no sound

3. dropping in a group the files did not replace labels or duration, they kept the old labels and durations, but cues seemed to change sound files. The new cues played  (dropping the same files a 2nd time updated the names)

4. soundfilebutton - need to debounce after the gesture slide out of gain slider and meter, sometimes accidentally trigger the cue to play

5. pause - when paused playing a new should stop all active cues without fading and immediately start the new cue - and turn of pause state

6. stop - should reset the pause state, and remove all active cues without fading or playing any of them

7. sometimes loading settings window crashes the app

8. populating over buttons that already have files assigned needs and option to cancel the operation

9. On crashes, all background processes need to stop (maybe check for heartbeat?)
